Machine Learning Framework

This repository contains an R-based machine learning framework
It includes code for implementing various machine learning algorithms, such as Lasso, StepCox, and other models, to predict patient survival outcomes. 

Code: R scripts for model training, validation, and feature selection.
Data: Example data files used for model testing

To run the code, you'll need to have R installed. The following R packages are required:
library(openxlsx)
library(seqinr)
library(plyr)
library(survival)
library(randomForestSRC)
library(glmnet)
library(plsRcox)
library(superpc)
library(gbm)
library(mixOmics)
library(survcomp)
library(CoxBoost)
library(survivalsvm)
library(BART)
library(snowfall)
library(ComplexHeatmap)
library(RColorBrewer)
